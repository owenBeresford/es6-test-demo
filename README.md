UPDATE 2021: I have stopped using Mocha,. as it poorly integates with Modules or recent JS.

# VERY BORING

### es6-test-demo
A template for Mocha/Chai combo. 

The actual code will perform computation from a string of arithmatic symbols. 
The first version of this I wrote for alevel coursework. 
This edition is just to have a template, as there are to many online articles which are wrong (or somehow wrong version of tool/lib). 

 I repeat: boring
